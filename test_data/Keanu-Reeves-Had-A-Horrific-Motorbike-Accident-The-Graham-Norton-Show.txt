0:00, Norton, you do ride motorbikes don't you 
0:02, Reeves, yes yeah 
0:03, Norton, but like a lot is that your main way of getting around
0:06, Reeves, yeah pretty much yeah little Norton commando yeah English twin
0:11, Unknown Man, I'm sorry did you just say a Norton commando between your legs at least one person sitting very close to you is imagining exactly that right now
0:24, Norton, I I saw that picture of you straddling your bike the jokes write themselves we're not going there but i mean you do fall off motorbikes a lot 
0:37, Reeves, yeah I've had some I've you know what it's a weird thing I've had some good luck and some bad luck 
0:42, Norton, you're alive 
0:43, Reeves, that's the good luck the bad luck is I've got a fake tooth I've got a huge scar here I've got a I guess a plate in my neck about this but that's not all just the motorcycles but yeah I've come off the bike a few times yeah 
0:56, Norton, but wasn't there time you scarred your leg 
0:59, Reeves, yeah that was the one where a car pulled out in front of me and and I was kind of trying to decide this was just after I had the plate in the neck and I was deciding if I was kind of about to hit the car because I started to veer but then the car saw me and started to move and then he stopped and I was just like oh man what am I getting so then I was trying to decide whether to drop the bike or to jump off the bike and go over the car and then by the time I kind of figured that all out I took the bumper off of his car and I ended up sitting on the ground and then that bike was just lying over there and then like tooth was cut in half and I had blood in my mouth and then the guy came over and he was freaking out but I was in shock so I was like it's okay but the thing about it is that I was getting as I was sitting on my skin was open on my shin oh and bone white is very white it's like so I kept touching it and my friend was like look how white that is and so then this woman who came up said is everything okay and then she kind of was there and the paramedics and she was like is that Keanu Reeves and she's like can I have your autograph
